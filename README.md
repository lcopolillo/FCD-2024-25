## Dependencies

The dependencies required to run the project are specified in the `requirements.txt` file. 

## Installation Guide

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lcopolillo/FCD-2024-25.git
cd repository
```

### 2. Set up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate package dependencies. To create a virtual environment in the project directory, run:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
```bash
.\myenv\Scripts\activate
```

- On Linux or macOS
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Dependecies

With the virtual environment activated, install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Project

Now, you're ready to run the project.

In [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), select 'Run All' to execute the scripts at once. Or, select the 'Run' button next to each of the scripts to execute them individually.

### 5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply running:

```bash
deactivate
```
